# Albion Refine

Albion Refine is a powerful tool designed for Albion Online players. This application helps you calculate the profit from refining and crafting activities, providing accurate and detailed information about costs, materials, and profits. No more guessing or gambling—use Albion Refine to optimize your crafting and refining strategies!

## Features

- **Profit Calculation for Refining & Crafting**: Instantly calculate your profit margins for both refining and crafting items.
- **Toggle Features On/Off**: Easily enable or disable specific features at the top of the app.
- **Automatic Price Data Fetching**: Retrieve up-to-date price data directly from the [Albion Big Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com). This feature saves you time and ensures you're using the latest market information.
  - **Note**: While the data fetched is quite accurate, it may vary by up to 10% from in-game prices. For the best results, double-check prices manually if possible.
  - **Server-Specific Pricing**: Make sure to select the correct server as prices differ between servers.

## Upcoming Updates

- **Crafting & Refining Integration**: We are working on a feature that links refining results with crafting options. This will allow you to see what crafting items can be made from your refined materials.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.
- **Vite**: For fast and optimized development and build tooling.
- **Zustand**: For managing application state effectively.
- **Supabase**: For backend infrastructure and database management.
